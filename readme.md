# OpenTutorial

> The last tutorial plugin you'll never need

# Description

OpenTutorial is a tutorial plugin utilizing a format for making ordered collections of sequential actions with potential conditions for proceeding

OpenTutorial follows a sequential path and as such has a major limitation in that it cannot have branching actions.

A further rendition of OpenTutorial may fix this.

//TODO: Said format must be migrated to Conversation and the ticket bot

obligatory EXCEPTIONS ARE NOT BAD. i need to explain this to users so they doin't think its a buggy shitfest when in reality
exceptions are how we signal incorrect behavior yet the average ignorant server owner doesn't understand this and uses
actually buggy shitcode that doesn't throw exceptions and hogs memory and cpu
