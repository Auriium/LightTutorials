# OpenTutorial

OpenTutorial is a tutorial plugin utilizing a format for making ordered collections of sequential actions with potential conditions for proceeding

OpenTutorial follows a sequential path and as such has a major limitation in that it cannot have branching actions.

A further rendition of OpenTutorial may fix this.

//TODO: Said format must be migrated to Conversation and the ticket bot
